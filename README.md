## Typography

The font chosen for this game is "Sigmar" which is taken from Google fonts. I chose this fotn because I believe it looks playful and is therefore appropriate for a game, it is interesting and should grab the user's attention and it is tasteful.

## Color scheme

The colour scheme for this website was made by chosing the colour "#ED832D" and then using https://mycolor.space to generate a colour palette:

White was also added to this colour palette to brighten the page up as the grey colours suggested sometimes seemed too dull.

# Features

## Favicon

A meat chop/cut of meat favicon was used to fit in with the theme of the game, this was taken from https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/cut-of-meat/.

## Game title

The game title was chosen as it seemed an appropriate play on words for the concept of the game and is catchy, prompting the user to remember it and draw them back to the site. The typography, colour scheme and size were combined to make the game title striking when the user first looks at the page. This partnered with the font awesome icon used: https://fontawesome.com/icons/bowl-food?f=classic&s=solid shows the user the name and theme of the game.

## How to play button

The "how to play" button has been put right underneath the game title so that the user can easily access information on how to play the game without scrolling the page. The button colour changes when the user hovers over the button, clarifying to the user the action they need to take and to entice the user to click. The design of the button is fitting with the rest of the game theme and helps the page flow easily. When the user clicks on the how to play button, a modal opens with instructions on how to play the game.

## Reset button
The reset button has been put next to the how to play button, as logically it seems that they would be part of the same groups and right underneath the game title so that the user can easily access it when they want to reset the game. The button colour changes when the user hovers over the button, clarifying to the user the action they need to take and to entice the user to click. The design of the button is fitting with the rest of the game theme and helps the page flow easily. When the user clicks on the reset button, the page reloads causing the game and scores to reset.
